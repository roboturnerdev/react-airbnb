More React practice coming right up!

Update: I have completed what I wanted with this specific task. I have moved on to more React projects and plan to implement CRS, CRUD, logging, auth, and containerization in the upcoming projects. I look at this as a great way to implement all the things I have learned over specific projects and start to build a larger app with the components, similar to the Yelp-Camp app at the end of WDB21 by Colt Steele.
